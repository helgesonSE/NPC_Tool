# State of the code 08/11 - 23:
# Main functionality in place. Code is currently rife with repeated lines, and what's there is not consistently
# formulated. The next step will be a major refactoring of the code to make it standardized and also creating some
# method(s) to dynamically create menus based on parameters. The NPC class/subclasses can surely be tidied up as well.
