# State of the code 21/10 - 23:
# Main functionality in place. Still missing the option to save newly added NPCs to file. Code is currently rife with
# repeated lines, and what's there is not consistently formulated. After adding a save function, the next step will be
# a major refactoring of the code to mkae it standardized and also creating some method to dynamically create menus
# based on parameters.
