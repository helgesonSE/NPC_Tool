NPC manager tool

The app will have two parts. 

The first allows the user to input the stats for enemy NPC:s, as well as reading from a file. The user can save their
entered NPC:s to file as well. The NPC:s have the following properties: NAME, HP, GUARD, ATTACK SKILL, DEFENCE SKILL,
ARMOUR, DESCRIPTION. They are divided into two types, of which the second will have the additional property WEAPON
(name and damage).

The second part allows the user to select one or more NPC:s to display in the console. It then allows the user to
trigger defence or attack rolls (with damage) from the NPC:s. Damage dealt to the NPC:s will be tracked.

Values and dice rolls will be made according to the rule set of the swedish TTRPG Kopparhavets Hj√§ltar, which I have
the pleasure of GMing.
